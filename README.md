Mostly inactive; playing with 24GHz and 660THz.
Sole kit is Quangshen HT on 2 & 70.
Until I get aroung to building SDR transceiver for 40/30/20.

Herewith a repository for C code and Python code created by AI and hacked by myself.
No responsibility.  Use at your own risk.

I'm scratch building a CNC machine with a cutting laser and probably a routing spindle too.
The innovation is tilting the laser head to cut at an angle.  Working on it.

Don't be mean about my coding.
I used to be moderately proficient, but since a brain injury, I struggle.
Programming has become therapy for my mind.
I really need an oscilloscope for this stuff.
