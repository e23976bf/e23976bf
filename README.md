Mostly inactive; playing with 24GHz and 660THz.

Sole kit is Quangshen HT on 2 & 70.

Until I get aroung to building SDR transceiver for 40/30/20.

Herewith a repository for C code and Python code created by AI and hacked by myself.

No responsibility.  Use at your own risk.

C seems to be the only language that I am moderately familiar with, that is still in common use. Pascal, Algol, BASIC, forth, all seem to have become obsolete. I've never used object-oriented languages before. Python is an interesting novelty to me. C++ and Java, I will get around to eventually.  No hurry.

I'm scratch building a CNC machine with a cutting laser and probably a routing spindle too.  The innovation is tilting the laser head to cut at an angle.  Working on it.

Arduino uno, pi pico, esp32....  I need a real raspberry, but I really appreciate the <$10 dev boards available from China.  But you have to be technically proficient in order to discover and accommodate the oddities inherent in cheap copies.

Don't be mean about my coding.

I used to be moderately proficient, but since a brain injury, I struggle.

Programming has become therapy for my mind.

I really need an oscilloscope for this stuff.
